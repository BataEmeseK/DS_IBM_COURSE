# Project Assignment 

Hey, I am Bata Emese and this is my first Jupiter Notebook Assigment that I will submit for peer review. 

Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:

1. Python
2. SQL
3. R
4. Julia

Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:

1. pandas (Python)
2. numpy (Python)
3. ggplot (R)
4. TenserFlow (Phyton/C++)

 |Data Science Tools: |
 |--------------------|
 |Anaconda |
 | Jupiter notebooks |
 |R studio |

 Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python:
 


```python
5+(5*8)-9
```




    36



This will convert 650 minutes to hours:


```python
650/60
```

 Some of the key takeaways from the course are the following:

**Objectives:**
- getting familiar with Phyton 
- Learining about GitHub and creating an account
- Learning that Kernels are computational engine that executes the code contained in a notebook file
